/* Credits / Changelog:
 * version 1.0 Initial build by Paul Reioux
 * version 1.1 Added 1800ma limit to table by Dorimanx
 * version 1.2 Added Fake AC interface by Mankindtw@xda and Dorimanx 
 * (update 22/10/14 mod deleted, it's bugged and useless)
 * version 1.3 Misc fixes to force AC and allowed real 1800mA max.
 *
 * Next versions depend on code for LG G2 Device!!! (Dorimanx)
 * version 1.4 Added usage of custom mA value for max charging power,
 * Now we can use Intelli Thermal and get full power charge, this was controlled by
 * default ROM thermal engine, not any more, code will check if battery if not above 50c
 * and allow max charge!
 * version 1.5/6/7/8 trying to perfect fast charge auto on/off and auto tune based on connection type
 * and battery heat.
 * version 1.9 Added Auto fast charge on/off based on battery %, if above 95% then fast charge is OFF
 * when battery is below 95% and fast charge was ON by user before, then it's enabled again.
 * version 2.0 Guard with mutex all functions that use values from other code to prevent race and bug.
 * version 2.1 Corect Mutex guards in code for fastcharge.
 * version 2.2 allow to charge on 900ma lock.
 * version 2.3 added more checks to thermal mitigation functions and corrected code style.
 * removed updating charging scenario when no charger connected. no point to do so.
 * version 2.4 removed 2000 and 1800ma sets, as STOCK code allow only 1600, i dont want to change that.
